## My tool to create a modified copy of Binance transactions history .csv files

#### THE GOAL: I want only one line for each transaction, so I need to:

<ol>
  <li>Set appropriate headers to the new .csv file;</li>
  <li>Make sure that each transaction's data goes into the right column of the new .csv file;</li>
  <li>Iterate through each transaction to find related transactions and compile them into a single line.</li>
</ol>

<small>
<em>/!\ The format of the modified .csv file (its headers) should be generic so that I can use it as a template to modify other CryptoExchanges' transactions history .csv files...</em>
